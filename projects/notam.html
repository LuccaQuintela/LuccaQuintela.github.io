                                    Our team of CU Boulder computer science students was approached by Boeing/Jeppesen to design an automated solution that could save them 
                                    an extensive amount of man power. 
                                </p>

                                At the moment, Boeing/Jeppesen has a team of people who are 24/7 dedicated to categorizing pieces of information
                                that pilots need to read (NOTAMs) before taking off in order to fly safely. By categorizing these NOTAMs, Boeing/Jeppesen can 
                                easily filter through the information and highlight the most important parts before it reaches the pilots, making their job easier. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="style1">
                                We trained multiple different machine learning models, starting with pre-trained versions of MiniLM and DistilBERT and then fine-tuning it
                                to focus on our specific use case, as is industry standard. The results vary between models, but they all outperform manual categorization 
                                in terms of speed and consistency with all models having accuracies and F1 scores above 90%. This allows Boeing/Jeppesen to allocate their 
                                resources more efficiently while maintaining high accuracy in NOTAM categorization.
                            </p>
                            <p class="style1">
                                I also built an iOS app completely from scratch to demonstrate our models in a user friendly manner that anyone can understand. When the 
                                user enters the app, they can choose which model they would like to use and then they can submit a NOTAM for classification. They have the choice
                                between submitting their own or choosing from our provided library of examples. The app then parses the NOTAM in order to route it to the correct model.
                                Next, it runs inference locally and then processes the model's output into a single, final prediction. Finally, it visualizes this to the user along with
                                how confident the model is in that prediciton.
                            </p>

                                Throughout this project, I actively utilized Swift to build the app and Python along with the PyTorch library to help train the models. I also used 
                                the Pandas library to effectively clean and preprocess the vast amounts of training data we were using. We made use of agile methodology and employed
                                sprints to break down development into manageable tasks, ensure continuous progress, and adapt quickly to evolving project requirements.

                            Unfortunately, our git repository for model training contains proprietary Boeing data and therefore cannot be shared.
                            However, the code for the iOS demonstration app is public and I invite you to check out the project on github below.
